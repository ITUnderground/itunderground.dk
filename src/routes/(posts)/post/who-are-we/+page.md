## Our organisation

**_ITUnderground_** is a student organisation from the IT University of Copenhagen that engages in offensive cybersecurity â€” also known as hacking.  
We teach everything from cryptography to forensics to privelege escalation.

## So what do we do?

We come together roughly every other week where we chill and hack, usually doing HackTheBox where your task is to hack into a remote server, or CTFs which are jeopardy-style hacking challenges.

Sometimes we host **workshops** or _talks_ about interesting things in the hacking space. Have a topic you want to talk/learn more about? Let us know and we'll see what we can do!

## Wanna participate?

**Don't know anything about hacking but want to get started?** The best way to learn is by doing, and at ITUnderground we offer a place where you can contribute to a collaborative learning environment. Just show up for one of our meetups and we'll teach you how to get started!
