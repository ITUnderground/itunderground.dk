## Join us for an event!

We meet up every other week on odd-numbered weeks. We usually meet Thursdays at **16:00** and post on [Discord](/pages/discord) about what room we are in. We usually stay until around **20:00**, but you can drop by or leave whenever you want! This semester our events are on weeks 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. 
 
We also sometimes participate in public [CTFs](/pages/resources#whats-a-ctf) as a University Hacking Team. Info about these events is posted in our [Discord server](/pages/discord).
